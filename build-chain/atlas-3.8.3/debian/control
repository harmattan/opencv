Description: Automatically Tuned Linear Algebra Software, generic shared
 ATLAS is an approach for the automatic generation and optimization of
 numerical software. Currently ATLAS supplies optimized versions for the
 complete set of linear algebra kernels known as the Basic Linear Algebra
 Subroutines (BLAS), and a subset of the linear algebra routines in the
 LAPACK library.
 .
 The libraries in this package are built without any processor extension
 instructions, and should run on all processors of this general
 architecture, albeit less than optimally.  
 . 
 Before version 3.8.3-25, optimized binary packages were provided.
 However, due to the fact that most Atlas optimisation are done at build time,
 it has been decided to remove them and give priority to locally built packages.
 . 
 For more information on how to rebuild locally atlas, see the section:
 "Building Optimized Atlas Packages on your ARCH" in README.Debian

# Description: Automatically Tuned Linear Algebra Software, EV6 static
#  ATLAS is an approach for the automatic generation and optimization of
#  numerical software. Currently ATLAS supplies optimized versions for the
#  complete set of linear algebra kernels known as the Basic Linear Algebra
#  Subroutines (BLAS), and a subset of the linear algebra routines in the
#  LAPACK library.
#  .
#  This package includes the static libraries and symbolic links
#  needed for program development.

# Description: Automatically Tuned Linear Algebra Software, 2.0 shared
#  ATLAS is an approach for the automatic generation and optimization of
#  numerical software. Currently ATLAS supplies optimized versions for the
#  complete set of linear algebra kernels known as the Basic Linear Algebra
#  Subroutines (BLAS), and a subset of the linear algebra routines in the
#  LAPACK library.
#  .
#  These libraries use the hand-tuned assembler kernels that run on  
#  2.0 and later procesors.
#  .
#  On some architectures, multiple binary packages are provided to take
#  advantage of certain commonly available processor instruction set
#  extensions.  The instruction extension set used is indicated in the
#  package name, with 'base' denoting no extensions. In general, you
#  will obtain the best performance by installing the package with the
#  most advanced instruction extension set your machine is capable of
#  running.
