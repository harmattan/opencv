OpenCV for Meego/Harmattan 1.2
==============================

Sadly there are not a lot of packages yet available for this platform, so in
order to build OpenCV I have had to fill out the build chain somewhat. Hence,
this repository includes a lot of packages which are needed for OpenCV but
unfortunately not yet available from a "standard" source.

Packages included
-----------------

Notes:
1. Unless otherwise mentioned, package sources have been taken from Debian
Squeeze.
2. Generally I have maintained the release number, appending "harmattan1" to
make it clear that the build is for this platform. The exception to this rule
was gcc, which would have required other more intrusive changes to append this
string.

OpenCV 2.3.1 - from Debian Experimental
Atlas 3.8.3
 * Fix gfortran lib path
 * Munged nflop factor until it worked.
 * Removed dependency on texlive-latex-base
Blas 1.2
 * Remove dependency on texlive-latex-recommended
Lapack 3.2.1
 * Remove dh_shlibdeps generation of lib dependencies which broke due to
   libblas' use of update-alternatives in /usr/lib
Python-numpy 1.4.1
Cpufrequtils 007
Gcc 4.4
 * It was only necessary to build gcc for gfortran-4.4, which is not available
   in the standard Harmattan SDK repositories, despite other packages from the
   same source package being available.
 * Removed dependency on texlive-latex-base
Gcc-defaults 1.92
Audiofile 0.2.6
Dirac 1.0.2
 * Remove dependency on texlive-base-bin and texlive-latex-base
Faad2 2.7
Ffmpeg 0.5.4
 * Removed requirement for libdc1394-22-dev
 * Removed requirement for libschroedinger-dev
 * Removed requirement for libsdl1.2-dev
 * Removed requirement for libtheora-dev
 * Removed requirement for libvorbis-dev
 * Removed requirement for libxvmc-dev
Imlib2 1.4.2
 * Removed requirement for libid3tag0-dev
Libgsm 1.0.13
Openjpeg 1.3
Yasm 0.8.0

Unnecessary extensions which would have complicated the build chain have been
disabled where possible.

External packages required
--------------------------

All other packages required for the build change that have not been explicitly
mentioned above, come from the stardard Harmattan SDK sources.
