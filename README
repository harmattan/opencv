OpenCV for Meego/Harmattan 1.2
==============================

Sadly there are not a lot of packages yet available for this platform, so in
order to build OpenCV I have had to fill out the build chain somewhat. Hence,
this repository includes a lot of packages which are needed for OpenCV but
unfortunately not yet available from a "standard" source.

Packages included
-----------------

Notes:
1. Unless otherwise mentioned, package sources have been taken from Debian
Squeeze.
2. Generally I have maintained the release number, appending "harmattan1" to
make it clear that the build is for this platform. The exception to this rule
was gcc, which would have required other more intrusive changes to append this
string.

OpenCV 2.3.1 - from Debian Experimental
Atlas 3.8.3
Blas 1.2
Lapack 3.2.1
Python-numpy 1.4.1
Cpufrequtils 007
Gcc 4.4
Gcc-defaults 1.92
Audiofile 0.2.6
Dirac 1.0.2
Faad2 2.7
Ffmpeg 0.5.4
Imlib2 1.4.2
Libgsm 1.0.13
Openjpeg 1.3
Yasm 0.8.0

Unnecessary extensions which would have complicated the build chain have been
disabled where possible.

External packages required
