OpenCV for Meego/Harmattan 1.2
==============================

Sadly there are not a lot of packages yet available for this platform, so in
order to build OpenCV I have had to fill out the build chain somewhat. Hence,
this repository includes a lot of packages which are needed for OpenCV but
unfortunately not yet available from a "standard" source.


Installing
----------

Until there is an official community repository, these files are hosted on the
project site. Please add the following to your APT sources.list file:

deb http://projects.developer.nokia.com/opencv/files ./

Then run 'apt-get update' and 'apt-get install' for any of the desired packages
within the OpenCV framework, e.g. 'python-opencv' or 'libopencv-core2.3'.


Packages included
-----------------

Notes:
1. Unless otherwise mentioned, package sources have been taken from Debian
Squeeze.
2. Generally I have maintained the release number, appending "harmattan1" to
make it clear that the build is for this platform. The exception to this rule
was gcc, which would have required other more intrusive changes to append this
string.

OpenCV 2.3.1 - from Debian Experimental
Atlas 3.8.3
Blas 1.2
Lapack 3.2.1
Python-numpy 1.4.1
Cpufrequtils 007
Gcc 4.4
Gcc-defaults 1.92
Audiofile 0.2.6
Dirac 1.0.2
Faad2 2.7
Ffmpeg 0.5.4
Imlib2 1.4.2
Libgsm 1.0.13
Openjpeg 1.3
Yasm 0.8.0
V4l-utils
Linux-libc-dev 2.6.32

Unnecessary extensions which would have complicated the build chain have been
disabled where possible.


External packages required
--------------------------

All other packages required for the build change that have not been explicitly
mentioned above, come from the stardard Harmattan SDK sources.

linux-libc-dev was also required, which is usually built from the linux-2.6
source package. However this has not been made available publicly for the
Harmattan environment so the binary packages from Debian Squeeze were used.
Hopefully the ABI hasn't changed significantly. Source listed below.
