* Check options on the different other archs (altivec)
* See what will happen with AMD-optimized packages built under Intel CPU 

* Provide -dbg packages
Just need to c/c this stuff into debian/control:

Description: Automatically Tuned Linear Algebra Software,generic shared
 ATLAS is an approach for the automatic generation and optimization of
 numerical software. Currently ATLAS supplies optimized versions for the
 complete set of linear algebra kernels known as the Basic Linear Algebra
 Subroutines (BLAS), and a subset of the linear algebra routines in the
 LAPACK library.
 .
 The libraries in this package are built without any processor extension
 instructions, and should run on all processors of this general
 architecture, albeit less than optimally.  
 . 
 On some architectures, multiple binary packages are provided to take
 advantage of certain commonly available processor instruction set
 extensions.  The instruction extension set used is indicated in the
 package name, with 'base' denoting no extensions. In general, you
 will obtain the best performance by installing the package with the
 most advanced instruction extension set your machine is capable of
 running.
 .
 This package contains the debugging symbols of the library.
