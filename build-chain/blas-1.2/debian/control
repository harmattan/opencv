Package: libblas3gf
Architecture: any
Provides: libblas.so.3gf
Depends: ${shlibs:Depends}, ${misc:Depends}
Description: Basic Linear Algebra Reference implementations, shared library
 This package is a binary incompatible upgrade to the blas package.
 Several minor changes to the C interface have been incorporated. 
 One can maintain both versions on a system simultaneously to aid 
 in the transition.
 .
 BLAS (Basic Linear Algebra Subroutines) is a set of efficient
 routines for most of the basic vector and matrix operations. 
 They are widely used as the basis for other high quality linear
 algebra software, for example lapack and linpack.  This 
 implementation is the Fortran 77 reference implementation found
 at netlib. 
 .
 This package contains a shared version of the library.

 This package contains a set of programs which test the integrity
 of an installed blas-compatible shared library.  These programs
 may therefore be used to test the libraries provided by the 
 blas package as well as those provided by the atlas packages. 
 The programs are dynamically linked -- one can explicitly select 
 a library to test by setting the LD_LIBRARY_PATH or LD_PRELOAD
 environment variables.  Likewise, one can display the library
 selected using the ldd program in an identical environment.
